# Variables

# variable_name = variable_data

a = 1 #int
b = 2 #int
c = 3.5 #float
hi = "Hello World!" #string

# print(hi)
# print(a)

# When we set a variable, the app stores it, and we can use it later in the code.
# Comment out multiple lines at the same time `Ctrl+/`

# print(1 + 2)
# print(a + b)

# Dynamic type language = don t have to specify data type
# Strong type languages = have to specify data type (e.g. int a = 1)


# Most important method used in Python: the Type Method(check what type of data our variable is)

print(type(hi))
print(type(a))
print(type(c))

# Overwriting variables
# print(a) - first time it will print 1 from the previous value
# a = 4
# print(a) - second time it will print 4 from the newly set value


# Getting user input

# print("Hi, what is your name?")
# name = input()
# print("Hi")
# print(name)


# Make a program that takes the user`s name, age and DOB and print them back out.

print("Hello, what is your name?")
name = input()
print("Hi")
print(name)
print("How old are you?")
age = input()
print("Just to confirm that this is your age?")
print(age)
answer = input()
print("Great!So what is your date of birth?")
DOB = input()
print("So, this is your date of birth?")
print(DOB)
answer = input()
print("Thank you!")
